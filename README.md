# NetflixClone
This Netflix Clone is a front-end replica of the popular streaming platform, created using HTML and CSS. The project aims to mimic the look and feel of Netflixâ€™s homepage, including its sleek design, movie posters, and responsive layout. This clone serves as a great practice project for honing HTML and CSS skills and demonstrating the ability to recreate complex user interfaces.
